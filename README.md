# VisualMOT

This is a Xamarin Forms (iOS and Android) app that uses the DVSA MOT History API. It retrives an MOT and presents the user with options to add photos and comments which will then create a report incorporating these. It then allows the user to send the report via email or upload via FTP to a website and send a link in an SMS message.

All the configuration e.g. API keys is under `VisualMOT/Constants.cs`
